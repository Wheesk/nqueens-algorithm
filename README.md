# 🧠 Solving the N-Queens Problem with Exhaustive, Local, and Optimization Algorithms

This project implements and compares four different algorithmic approaches to solving the classic N-Queens problem. The goal of the N-Queens problem is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
2. **Hill Climbing**  
3. **Simulated Annealing**  
4. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  

## 🧪 Tested Board Sizes

- N = 10
- N = 30
- N = 50
- N = 100
- N = 200

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Measured runtime, conflicts, and success status for each algorithm.
